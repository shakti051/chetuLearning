3. Why leaving current job:-

“I’m not aggressively job searching right now, but I saw this position open up and 
it just seemed like such a great opportunity that I had to apply. 
I have learned a lot in my current role and worked with some great people;
but this position is very closely aligned with my skills as well the direction I want my career to go.
“I’ve also heard a lot about the diverse team and culture, 
and it seemed like too good of an opportunity to miss.”

4. If leaving job due to less salary:-

“I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time at my current company and have gained valuable experience. 
However, I’ve found that my compensation does not align with the industry standard. 
I believe that fair compensation is essential for job satisfaction and productivity, 
which is why I’m seeking new opportunities that offer a more competitive salary.”
